**Damien's Arcade** is a webgame server made using SvelteKit, ExpressJS, Typescript, and socket.io. Suitable for games with UIs made out of HTML5 elements or in PIXI.js and with low server performance requirements. It is adapted (heavily) from the server for my old game [Siphon State](https://github.com/damiensnyder/siphon-state).

As of writing (2/18/24), there are three games playable on it, called **Auction Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Mayhem Manager** (still in development), and **Daily Q-less**. I have plans in the future to add more games to the arcade; see [roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for a brief list of future plans.

You are free to contribute to the arcade (should the contributions be of matching quality and aesthetic), or fork it and make your own arcade. The project is designed to make it reasonably easy to add more types of games.
