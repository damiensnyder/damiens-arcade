**Damien's Arcade** is a webgame server made using SvelteKit, ExpressJS,
Typescript, and socket.io. It is set up to be deployed easily on Heroku, though could be easily adapted to another platform as well. Suitable for turn-based games with nice UIs and not a ton of concurrent players. It is adapted (heavily) from the server for my old game [Siphon State](https://github.com/damiensnyder/siphon-state).

As of writing (4/16/22), there is only one game playable on it, called **Auction Tic-Tac-Toe**. I have plans in the future to add more games to the arcade; see [todo.md](documentation/todo.md) for a brief list of future plans.

You are free to contribute more games to the arcade (should they be of matching quality and aesthetic), or fork it and make your own arcade. The project is designed to make it reasonably easy to add more types of games.
